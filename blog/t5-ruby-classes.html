   <p>
  Ruby is a versitile and powerful language that can be described as 'Object Oriented'. 'Classes' are one of these 'objects' which I will outline here.
  </p>
<p>

One of the key aspects in any programming is the idea of eliminating redundancy; finding repetitive code and finding a way to boil is all down to one logic train. This where classes come in.

<br/ ><br />

A Class is an object like any object in the physical world; it has named attributes and actions it is capable of. These named attributes and actions are created by the programmer. These attributes are also non-specific in that we can create a copy of the class and at that time send in specific details like numbers, etc.
