<h3>
   ++ Cyber Bullying - Harassment in the age of social media.
  </h3>

  <table id="blogs"><tr><td>


<p>

The advent and subsequent massive rise of social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter have allowed people to share their ideas and thoughts on a scale never before possible. Creativity and connection among people around the globe has flourished and is a wonderful thing to see develop in our lifetimes. 

<br /><br />

This freedom of expression while mostly positive has unfortunately also spawned another form of expression; harassment known as Cyber bullying. The ability to post anonymously has allowed mean spirited and cowardly individuals to harass from afar, hiding behind a false Facebook account or other false online identity. This harassment often allows the victim no recourse as the bully is anonymous and is difficult to determine who the perpetrator is. 

<br /><br />

This problem is a tough nut to crack on several levels. The first and possibly biggest issue with handling this problem is one of the foundations our country is based on; freedom of speech. How do we block and / or squelch expression of feelings and ideas while at the same time preserving our freedom to speak our mind? 

<br /><br />

It's shaky ground to begin to prosecute ideas or opinions as is and can very possibly lead to increased governmental controls over both the Internet and the information found there. 

<br /><br />

The solution to me seems to be multi-fold. As this is mostly a teenage issue, parents need to be aware of their kids actions and Internet dealings. Raise our kids correctly, instill a sense of honor and the idea that the strong defend the weak and stand up for those different and / or smaller than themselves. 

<br /><br />

Next I feel that the social media outlets need to implement greater internal controls (TRON?) over the content and police the portal more effectively. If abuses are occurring shut the user down that is hurting others, cancel accounts and even IP address blockage. 

<br /><br />

Both these possible solutions may help to al least limit Cyber bulling without the need for increased governmental involvement.
