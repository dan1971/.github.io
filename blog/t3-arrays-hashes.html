    2/22/2015 - Arrays and Hashes in Ruby
  </h3>

  <table id="blogs"><tr><td>
   <p>
  Arrays and Hashes are ways to store various multiple pieces of information so that they can be retrieved later and acted upon or viewed.
  </p>

++ Arrays 

</h3>
<p>

Arrays are collections of data and can be compared to a dresser with multiple drawers. Like a dresser that has 1 or more drawers which can contain differeent objects, an array also has 'drawers' where one can store things. The array is named whatever we'd like and each 'drawer' in the array is numbered which is how we can look within the space and see what's there.

</p>
<p>

 <code>
 my_array = ["Dragon","Fire",45,9,"swords"]
 </code>

<br /><br />

Let's look into drawer 0!

<br />
<br />

 <code>
 my_array[0] = "Dragon"
 </code>

</p>

<br />

<h3>
++ Hashes
</h3>
<p>

Hashes, like arrays, are also collections of data and can also be compared to a dresser which has drawers that can contain stuff. The difference is with Hashes we can give word names to each drawer as opposed to arrays where the drawers can only be numbered. Hashes are great to store information like products so we can label the drawer according to what will be contained in it.

</p>
<p>

<code>
 my_hash = { 

 <br />

'Product_id': 40321,

 <br />

'Product_name': 'The Master Ring'

 <br />

'Product_Cost': 'Your living soul'

 <br />

 }
 </code>

<br /><br />

Let's look into the drawer called: Product_name!

<br />
<br />

 <code>
 my_hash['Product_name'] = The Master Ring
 </code>

<br /><br />
