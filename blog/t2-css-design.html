    2/22/2015 - Classes and ID's Why and When?
  </h3>

  <table id="blogs"><tr><td>
   <p>
  Classes and Id'd are one of the cornerstones of CSS. These show just how useful CSS can be in applying styles from one location. 
  </p>
<p> 
  In traditional HTML styles such as font types, colors and sizes would be applied for each piece of copy on a page. This means that if a change to the style of the copy needs to be made the developer or site owner would have to make that change many times in many different places. CSS puts the styles in one location, making for easy changes and updates.
</p>
<p>
This is where Classes play their role. Classes are named groups of one or more styles which are then applied to many elements on a web-page:

Id's are similar in that they apply a named style however they are used when a style is just going to be used one time for one element.
