   <p>
  In general I try to live up to the following values:<br />
<ul>
<li>Fairness </li>
<li>Compassion </li>
<li>Quality</li>
<li>Empathy</li>
<li>Honesty</li>
<li>Accountability</li>
<li>Close relationships</li>
<li>Empathy</li>
<li>Affection</li>
<li>Openness</li>
<li>Truth</li>
<li>Romance</li>
<li>Self-knowledge</li>

</ul>

It's a difficult question to pick just one of the listed values to emphasize and speak about. They all are important to me and together form who I am as a person.

<br /><br />

Empathy is a good place to start as I feel this to be such an important part of my personality and heart. This quality enhances relationships with people around me and also my love of animals. 

<br /><br />

I feel centered when thinking about my values and only hope I can do my best to live up to all of them as much as I can. I am imperfect however and need to allow for that and give myself a break. Easier said than done. 

<br /><br />

I need always remember how alike we all are and that we are all in this together. Remembering we as people are one unit and not separate reminds me 'I'm not alone and do belong.
