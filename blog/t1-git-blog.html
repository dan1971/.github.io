      While at first glance, spending time learning to use git and it's online cohort Github may seem unnecessary extra work for the noob developer, it will ultimately offload stress and work down the road.  
      This is due to it's life-saving function of 'Version Control'. 
      Version control simply means as a project progresses, the project is saved as you, the developer, sets 'save points'.  This way if errors/and or bugs overwhelm the project, we can revert back to an earlier version that was working. Or if a mistake was made in adding or deleting a feature, again these things are easily corrected with version control.

        Git tracks changes when the developer via the command line saves the file and then uploads to Github:
          1.) git add [file]
          2.) git commit -m [file]
          3.) git push [GITHUB url]

    </p>
    <p>
        Storing code via Github has 2 distinct benefits:
          1.) Should disaster strike your local machine the project is all warm and safe in it's remote sleeping bag. Happy n safe. :)
          2.) The project can be worked on by a team of developers; Adding code and improving the project while NOT overwriting each other. It's a beautiful symbiosis.
