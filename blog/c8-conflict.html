      <h3>
      ++ Conflict Resolution: Acknowledge, Identify, Ownership
     </h3>

        Conflict can appear from many different sources as we live our lives. Many times the source is resulting from another person. Family, friends and even people we just met can create a "conflict". 
        I'm going to discuss a different source of conflict I had which didn't involve a another person at all. My conflict was with the City of San Francisco. 

      </p>
      <p> 
        I had been accepted to a computer coding academy and pulled up stakes in Orange County, California to move to San Francisco in order to attend this highly regarded school. After driving all day the arrival to the city in a 16 foot moving truck pulling a 12 foot trailer was daunting. I have not been to a city quite like this one and the critical mass of human habitation was overwhelming. 

      </p>

        As I struggled to navigate the streets to my address in 28 total feet of rolling bulk I finally arrived to my apartment. I immediately noticed there is no place to pull to the side in order to unload the contents of the truck. At this point I am at a complete loss as to what to do. I have to make a decision quick as there are cars behind me and I need to make the correct turns.

        I finally decide to take the truck and trailer to the after-hours drop off point, offload my Mini Cooper from the trailer and one load at a time ferry the contents of the truck over to the apartment in my Mini. This was time-consuming but solved the problem at the time. While engaging this process I began to notice the fact that in this city its acceptable to simply stop the vehicle, turn on the flashers and in effect, block the lane. This is not done where I come from and would only result in major problems from other drivers as well as the police.

        Once the task was completed I was very tired, hungry and angry at the City for not living up to what I expected and being such a pain in the neck! I was also frustrated with my advisor whom had lived in San Fran and didn't, I felt, give me the whole scope of the city and how to do this deal.
     </p>
      <p>
        Once I had eaten, rested and calmed down I realized the issue was with me, not my guide or the city itself. I failed to do complete research on the city and how things work. I should have asked more questions of my guide as far as fine detail about moving here and how to get that done in the best way.

     </p>
      <p>
      The point is that in all conflict It's very important to look at ourselves and recognize we always have a part in the conflict. We need to see our role and acknowledge the mistakes or actions we took in the conflict. Ownership is a very important attitude and takes practice but if we master this quality, life will be much more fluid, pleasant and enjoyable.
