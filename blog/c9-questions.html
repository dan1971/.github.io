  Asking questions is an important part of leaning a new skill, trade or technology. Some shy away from asking questions feeling as though its admitting lack of skill or expertise. The best and brightest leaders, managers and experts in the field know this to be untrue. Those at the top of their game know there always is more to learn from another perspective, even from those not yet at their own level of achievement.

  In the realm of computer coding asking questions is very important. With the abundance of tech forums available to developers, asking questions has never been easier and more accessible. Asking a question in the most clear and respectful way can mean the difference between getting an answer or receiving no response to the question at all.

When posting a question add title  your post with some hint at the problem. For example don't post "Ruby not working" or "Javascript error. Please help" 
Something more like: "Populating a Ruby Array" will get looked at quicker than the former example.

Clarity of the question is obviously very important, but equally important is showing an attempt was made at solving the problem. Nobody on the forums wants to do all the work for you, so post what you tried that didn't produce the result you wanted.

<br /><br />

Give back; Try to answer someone else's problem. Whenever I have a few minutes or each time I post a question I try to help someone with their coding problems.
