      I have great expectaions of the DBC experience. I love the culture and the level of empathy DBC has towards us cohorts and the challenges ahead. It calms my heart greatly!
      I also love the experimental nature of DBC and that I am one of the lucky ones that got in at this early and amazing stage of the DBC program!
        Yes I am a absolutely nervous! I want to do well! All I can do is be myself, give the process my heart and the rest will fall in place.
