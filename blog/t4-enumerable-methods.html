<h3>
    2/27/2015 - Using Enumerables - 'Map'
  </h3>

  <table id="blogs"><tr><td>
   <p>
    Enumerables, one of the workhorses of the Ruby language when it comes to looking through a collection of data, such as an array, and doing something with one or more pieces of that data. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I will show an example and explain the 'Map' Method and how it works:

  <br /><br />

  <code>

    an_array = ["dog","cat","fish","bird"] 

    <br />

    an_array.map { |x| x << " pet" }

  </code>

  <br /><br />

  First we see an array called an_array with animals in it. 

  <br />

  Next is the map method being called on the array. 

  <br />

  Inside the 'block', left to right, first we see an x. This 'x' is simply a variable and can be any letter; i , y , g whatever. This variable is used to represent each item in the array as the map method loops through the array per the number of items in the array. 

  <br /><br />

  So for each run (loop), 'x' represents an array item to which an equation is applied. 

  <br />

  The 'equation', which we can see above, comes after the '|x|'. In this case, the equation says "add the word 'pet' to the current item represented by 'x' in the array".

  <br /><br />

  There are many 'equations' we can apply to the variable in addition to the one shown above.

  </p>
