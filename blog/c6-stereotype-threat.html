<h3>
   ++ Stereotype Threat. Unfortunate reality of the mind.
  </h3>

  <table id="blogs"><tr><td>

<p>

Stereotype threat is an unfortunate and interesting psychological state where the individual creates in essence a 'self fulfilling prophecy'. ie. Wherever a member of a particular minority, gender or other group of people have a negative stereotype, they 'affirm' the stereotype and actually perform to that expectation.

<br /><br />

I personally have not witnessed this directly but do understand what seems to me a close relative of this topic; self deprecation. This may have impacted my achievement feeling less than and being in a state of perpetual cynicism and negativity. Feel as though the 'other shoe' is going to drop at some point anyway so why try at all, or, 'drop the shoe' pre-emptive. 

<br /><br />

There are certainly many ways to correct or at least mitigate this issue. I think one way is to stop focusing on our differences as people, acknowledge we as humans are one unit and treat all as we would like to be treated. When we truly operate in this state of mind, I believe this would come across to others and begin to alter the mental state of someone who may feel others are focused on and contemplating what 'group' they are a part of. 

<br /><br />

We need to begin to look at each other as one unit, not separate individuals. We are all as one, all on the planet Earth as a team with the same heart, emotions and goals. The goal to live our lives and be happy; we can do this together as a team and the sooner we start thinking and acting as a team, the sooner the world will improve.
