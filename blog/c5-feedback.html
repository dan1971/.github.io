<h3>
   ++ Cultural Blog: Pairing and Giving Feedback
  </h3>

  <table id="blogs"><tr><td>
   <p>
  Pairing and feedback are two aspects of DevBootcamp that are part of the curriculum and important to the learning process. I will offer my opinion and feelings regarding these two items. 
  </p>
<h3>
   Pairing
</h3>

<p>
  Pairing was a fun experience for me. I loved meeting my classmates and getting to know them. Getting through the assignments was generally efficient and I could see the value of teamwork on a project. 

  I did feel at times I would be able to get through a problem quicker and  found research and trying things was far faster if I worked it on my own.

<h3>
   Feedback
</h3>

<p>
   Feedback I found to be a double edged blade. It's very good to hear how others feel about you with regards to working together and handling projects. It's obviously great to hear when you've done well or was well received by someone. When the feedback wasn't as positive or was critical it's easy to get down on yourself and let it ruin your day. I feel however it's very important to learn where you need improvement in order to get better. It's very important to remember the most progress is made and learning is greatest through failures. No failures = no progress. 
  <br /><br />
  The feedback I've received has taught me I need to talk on a personal level a bit less and get down to business.
<br /><br />
  Writing feedback for me is tough. Even though I know feedback is critical for growth and is at times the ONLY way to determine where we stand and how were doing I still don't like criticizing people and have a hard time doing so.
<br /><br />
  I feel feedback is an invaluable tool for gauging progress and improving. While I do feel pairing can be efficient I also feel it's not ideal in ALL situations.
